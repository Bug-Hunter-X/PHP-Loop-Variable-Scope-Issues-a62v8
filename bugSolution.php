The solution involves ensuring that variables are accessed within their correct scope.  Here's the corrected code:

```php
function processArray(array $data) {
  $result = [];
  foreach ($data as $item) {
    $newValue = $item * 2; 
    $result[] = $newValue; 
  }

  //Correct: $result is used correctly within the function scope
  //Correct: anotherValue is defined in correct scope.
  $anotherValue = $result[0] * 2; 
  return $result;
}

$myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
$processedArray = processArray($myArray);
print_r($processedArray); // Output: Array ( [0] => 2 [1] => 4 [2] => 6 [3] => 8 [4] => 10 )
```

The improved code correctly uses the `$result` variable within the function's scope, ensuring it's accessible throughout the function.  The `$newValue` is only accessed within the `foreach` loop where it's defined, avoiding the undefined variable error.
