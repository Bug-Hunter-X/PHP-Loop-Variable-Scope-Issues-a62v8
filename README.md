# PHP Variable Scope Bug: Undefined Variable Error in Loops

This repository demonstrates a common PHP bug related to variable scope within functions and loops. The `bug.php` file contains code that incorrectly uses variables outside their defined scope, resulting in an undefined variable error. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version with proper scope handling.  This is a classic example of how a seemingly small oversight in scoping can lead to unexpected runtime errors. Understanding variable scope is crucial for writing clean and error-free PHP code.
