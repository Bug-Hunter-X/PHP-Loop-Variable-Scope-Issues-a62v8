In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with variable scope within functions and loops.  Consider this example:

```php
function processArray(array $data) {
  $result = [];
  foreach ($data as $item) {
    $newValue = $item * 2; 
    $result[] = $newValue; //Correct. Appending to $result
  }
  return $result;
}

$myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
$processedArray = processArray($myArray);
print_r($processedArray); // Output: Array ( [0] => 2 [1] => 4 [2] => 6 [3] => 8 [4] => 10 )
```

This works fine. However, if we accidentally use `$result` outside the foreach loop:

```php
function processArray(array $data) {
  $result = [];
  foreach ($data as $item) {
    $newValue = $item * 2; 
    $result[] = $newValue; 
  }
  // Incorrect: Using $result outside the loop scope
  //Incorrect: $newValue is also out of scope here
  $anotherValue = $result[0] + $newValue; //Error: Undefined variable $newValue
  return $result;
}
```

This will result in an error because `$newValue` is only available within the scope of the `foreach` loop, leading to undefined variable error. The same applies to `$result` if it was modified only inside the loop.  This often happens when developers accidentally use variables without understanding their scope properly, or with large functions and nested loops making it hard to trace the variable scope.
